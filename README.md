<h3> Defining the problem statement </h3>
  
Complete the analysis of what sort of people were likely to survive.
In particularly, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy

  <h3> Data Dictionary </h3>

* Survived : 0 = No, 1 = Yes
* Pclass : Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
* SibSp : # of sibling / spouses aboard the Titanic
* Parch : # of parents / children aboard the Titanic
* Ticket : Ticket number
* Cabin : Cabin number
* Embarked : Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

 <h3> Feature Engineering </h3>
 Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features (feature vectors) that make machine learning algorithms work.

 feature vector is an n-demensional vector of numerical features that represent some object. Many algorithms in machine learning require a numerical representation of objects,    since such representations facilitate processsing and statistical analysis.
